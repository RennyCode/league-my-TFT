## League My TFT

Base in javascript and react, this project is a simple webpage that presents my own teams for TFT in Leage Of Legend.
Using the League API the data for the champions is taken and presented

## Description

years a go back when TFT just came out i had the idea for new other team comboations TTFT can use, to display that i made a page in which you can select a team up to 9 champions, and see the activated effects.

The new original teams includes the types: Cove, Chrismas, Academy, Galaxy, Halloween, Police, Zombie and more.
Eventually most of the team concepts got implemented to some extent.
